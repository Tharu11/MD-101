Manage mobile devices with Intune

Device Management Lifecycle
Managing mobile devices, like most IT management activities, follows a lifecycle. The mobile device management lifecycle contains four phases:
* Enroll. 
* Configure.
* Protect. 
* Retire.

Explain considerations for device enrollment

There are several different ways to enroll Windows devices to MDM, based on device type and its current state, including:
* If a device is already joined to your on-premises AD DS, you can use Group Policy to automatically enroll it to MDM.
* You can configure integration between Azure AD and MDM so that when you join a Windows device to Azure AD, it’s automatically enrolled to MDM.
* You can enroll Windows devices to MDM manually, by using a Settings app, provisioning packages, or the Company Portal app.

Explore device enrollment manager

Example of a device enrollment manager scenario

What can a device enrollment manager do?
Only users in Azure AD can be added as a device enrollment manager.

The DEM user can:
* Enroll up to 1000 devices in Intune
* Sign in to the Company Portal to get company apps
* Configure access to company data by deploying role-specific apps to the tablets

Limitations of devices that are enrolled with a DEM account
Devices that are enrolled with a device enrollment manager account have the following limitations:
* No per-user access. Because devices don't have an assigned user, the device has no email or company data access. VPN configurations, for example, could still be used to provide device apps with access to data.
* The DEM user can't unenroll DEM-enrolled devices on the device itself by using the Company Portal. The Intune admin can unenroll.
* Only the local device appears in the Company Portal app or website.
* Users can’t use Apple Volume Purchase Program (VPP) apps with user licenses because of per-user Apple ID requirements for app management.
* (iOS only) If you use DEM to enroll iOS devices, you can't use the Apple Configurator, Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP), or Apple School Manager (ASM) to enroll devices. This means that you can't put the device in supervised mode and thus won't have access to some configuration options.
* (Android only) There's a limit to the number of Android work profile devices that can be enrolled with a single DEM account. Up to 10 Android work profile devices may be enrolled per DEM account. This limitation doesn't apply to legacy Android enrollment.
* Devices can install VPP apps if they have device licenses.
* An Intune device license isn't required to use DEM.
Add a device enrollment manager
* Sign in to Endpoint Manager admin center located at https://endpoint.microsoft.com.
* In the left navigation, select Devices - Enroll devices - Device enrollment managers.
* Select Add. On the Add User panel, enter a user principal name for the DEM user, and select Add. The DEM user is added to the list of DEM users.
Permissions for DEM

Global or Intune Service Administrator Azure AD roles are required to:
* Complete tasks that are related to DEM enrollment in the Admin Portal
* Access all DEM users despite role-based access control (RBAC) permissions being listed and available under the custom User role

Manage devices remotely

The Devices feature provides additional details into the devices you manage, including their hardware and the apps installed. To view all your devices, and their properties do the following:
