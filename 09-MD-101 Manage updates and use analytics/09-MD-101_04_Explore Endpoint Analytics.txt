Explore Endpoint Analytics


Sometimes there are issues that affect user productivity less visible or historically difficult to pinpoint. 
Help desk tickets containing a title along the lines of "User reports device seems slow" are as old as the computer itself.
What's worse is users might come to accept a device's poor performance, ignoring a real issue that ultimately reduces productivity. 
When this issue is reported, it can often be labor-intensive trying to identify to root cause.

Enroll devices in Endpoint Analytics

It's not uncommon for end users to experience long boot times or other disruptions. These disruptions can be due to a combination of:
* Legacy hardware
* Software configurations that aren't optimized for the end-user experience
* Issues caused by configuration changes and updates

Requirements 

To enroll devices via Intune requires:
* Intune enrolled or co-managed devices
* Windows devices must be Azure AD joined or hybrid Azure AD joined. Workplace joined or Azure AD registered devices aren't supported.
* Network connectivity from devices to the Microsoft public cloud.
* The Intune Service Administrator role is required to start gathering data.

To enroll devices via Configuration Manager requires:
* A minimum of Configuration Manager version 2002 with KB4560496 or later
* The Configuration Manager clients upgraded to version 2002 (including KB4560496) or later
* Microsoft Endpoint Manager tenant attach enabled.
* Enable Endpoint analytics for devices uploaded to Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

Endpoint Analytics compared to Desktop Analytics
Endpoint Analytics is a different solution than Desktop Analytics. They are similar in concept, and some metrics do overlap. However, the main differences between these two products include:
* Desktop Analytics focuses on assessing compatibility. Endpoint Analytics focuses more on the health of the device and user experience.
* Desktop Analytics requires Endpoint Configuration Manager, where Endpoint Analytics does not.
* Desktop Analytics only integrates with Configuration Manager. Endpoint Analytics supports clients that are enrolled in either Configuration Manager or Intune.

Monitor startup performance and restarts

The Startup score is a number between 0 and 100, and these scores are averaged to provide an overall tenant boot score. This score is a weighted average of Boot score and the Sign-in score, which are computed as follows:
* Boot score.
* Sign-in score.

Insights
The Startup performance page has reporting tabs that provide support for the insights, including:
* Model performance.
* Device performance.
* Startup processes.

Restart frequency
* Abnormal shutdowns.
* Normal shutdowns.

Monitor application reliability

App reliability score

Each application on the App performance tab is assigned an App reliability score based on:
* Crash frequency.
* Total usage duration.

App performance

For each application in the report, the following data is provided:
* App name.
* App display name.
* App publisher.
* Active devices (14 days).
* Total usage duration (14 days).
* Total crashes (14 days).
* Mean time to failure.
* App reliability score.

App performance details

Selecting an app name in the table from App performance opens App performance details. App performance details contain two tabs:
* App versions.
* OS versions.
