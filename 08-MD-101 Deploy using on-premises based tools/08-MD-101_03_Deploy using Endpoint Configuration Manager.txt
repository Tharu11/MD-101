Deploy using Endpoint Configuration Manager


Both the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and Configuration Manager use a similar interface for an OS deployment. 
However, the MDT is primarily a solution for operating system deployment.
Configuration Manager is a much more robust solution for client management. 
This module explains the common day to day tasks that Administrators would use Configuration Manager to perform.

Explore client deployment using Configuration Manager

The following Microsoft management solutions are all now part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager:
* Configuration Manager
* Microsoft Intune
* Desktop Analytics
* Windows Autopilot
* Other features in the Device Management Admin console

The foundations of MDT
Some options and methods were more readily available in MDT than they were in Configuration Manager, including:
* Some of the key benefits of combining the tools include:
* Access to a wider expanse of task sequence variables with which to utilize during OS deployment.
* MDT Rules engine offers a raft of in-built options to aid OS deployment.
* The ability to install Windows features without the knowledge of code.
* Log file collection out of a template task sequence wizard.

Manage client deployment using Configuration Manager

Task Sequences
Some of the scenarios for using a task sequence include:
* Deploying an operating system to a new or rebuilt device.
* Deploying a Windows upgrade.
* Capturing an operating system image for use in a deployment sequence.
* Capturing and restoring user state settings.
* Customizing a task sequence to carry out more advanced configurations.

Log Files
Some examples include the following:
* Ccmsetup.log.
* SMSTS.log.
* AppEnforce.log. 
* Execmgr.log.

Plan in-place upgrades using Configuration Manager

Considerations for In-place Upgrades
The following considerations might be critical in determining whether you can perform an in-place upgrade:
* The operating system and edition that can be upgraded to Windows.
* Sufficient hardware resources.
* Windows 10 or Windows 11â€“compatible hardware and apps.

Running Setup.exe creates several XML files that you can open and inspect for issues.
* 32-bit OS. 
* OS language. 
* Dual boot/multiboot.
* Windows To Go/VHD. 
* Standard image only.
