Deploy using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit


There are several on-premises methods that have been traditionally used to facilitate OS deployments within organizations.
While newer cloud-based solutions have frequently simplified many methods and processes, on-premises tools still have a place in modern management.
In this module, we’ll discuss these shifts from traditional to modern management, and where on-premises solutions best fit in today’s enterprise.

Set up the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit for client deployment

MDT setup prerequisites

To enable a successful Windows deployment, you must plan and assemble the MDT infrastructure prior to the delivery of the operating system.
Some of the key elements of the architecture of an MDT delivery include:
* Active Directory Domain Services Environment.
* Windows 2016 or later server.
* Windows ADK.
* Windows Deployment Services (optional).
* Windows Server Update Services (optional). 

Exploring MDT
* Windows 10 or later client support.
* Windows Server 2016 and later support.
* The ability to automate a sequential set of tasks into a single repeatable deliverable, that can be then replicated onto many devices. This can include the installation of an operating system, line-of-business applications, language packs, scripts, and more.
* Deployment of a user empowering interface that enables end users to customize their Windows OS installation.
* Displays the status of currently running deployments.
* Offline BitLocker, which saves hours of encryption time by having BitLocker enabled during the Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) phase.
* Support for running the User State Migration Tool (USMT) capture offline, during the Windows PE phase of the deployment.
* Granular customization that enables the IT Admin to deliver an OSE tailored to the organization’s needs.

Exploring the components of MDT

The key components of Deployment Workbench include:
* Operating system (OS images). 
* Applications.
* Drivers.
* Packages.
* Task Sequences.

Manage and deploy images using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit

Deploy a reference image with a task sequence
Some of the key steps in the development task sequence and their role in delivering an automated delivery of Windows include:
* Gather. 
* Format and Partition Disk.
* Apply OS Image. 
* Inject Drivers.
* Install Applications.

Methods of installation
The following provides a brief overview and comparison between traditional and modern methods:
* In traditional deployments, lite-touch installations (LTI) are automated deployments that require some user intervention, such as a user must be present at the computer to initiate an installation, which then continues automatically.
* In zero-touch installations (ZTI), the deployment is completely automated without any user intervention and can be initiated without user intervention.
* With user-driven installations (UDI), the user can interact during the deployment, giving them certain choices for configuration.
