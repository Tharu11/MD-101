Deploy and update applications


In this module, you will be introduced to application deployment in Intune. 
You will learn about deploying software using Group Policy and get an overview of Microsoft Store for Business.
You will examine how to configure Microsoft Store for Business and how to integrate it with Intune.
The lesson will then conclude with information about how to use Microsoft Store for Business.

Deploy applications with Intune

This functionality is in addition to managing devices and protecting data. One of an admin's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. This goal can be a challenge because:
* There are a wide range of device platforms and app types.
* You might need to manage apps on both company devices and users' personal devices.
* You must ensure that your network and your data remain secure.

* Store app. 
* Microsoft 365 apps.
* Web link.
* Built-in app.
* Line-of-business (LOB) app.
* Windows app (Win32).


Manage Win32 apps with Intune
In order to deploy Win32 apps, the following criteria must be met:
* Windows 10 version 1607 or later (Enterprise, Pro, and Education versions)
* Devices must be joined to Azure AD and auto-enrolled.
* Windows application size has a maximum of 8 GB per app.

Some features worth noting include:
* Both 32-bit and 64-bit apps are supported.
* Dependencies of other apps and install requirements can be defined.
* The Intune Management Extension supports Azure AD joined, hybrid domain joined, group policy enrolled devices are supported.
Deploying applications with Group Policy

Use Group Policy to manage the software lifecycle

Using Group Policy to manage the software lifecycle has some advantages and some disadvantages that are important to consider. The advantages of using Group Policy to manage the software lifecycle are:
* Group Policy software distribution is available as part of Group Policy and AD DS. 
* Group Policy software distribution does not require client software, agent software, or additional management software.
* Group Policy software distribution is quick and easy to use.

The disadvantages of using Group Policy to manage the software lifecycle are:
* Group Policy software distribution has a minimal feature set.
* Group Policy software distribution does not have any reporting.
* Group Policy software distribution is limited to deployment of Windows Installer packages.

How Windows Installer enhances software distribution

The Windows Installer service has the following characteristics:
* This service runs with elevated privileges, so that the Windows Installer service can install software regardless of which user is signed into the system. Users only require read access to the software distribution point.
* Applications are resilient. If an application becomes corrupted, the installer will detect and reinstall or repair the application.
* Windows Installer cannot install .exe files. To distribute a software package that installs with an .exe file, you must convert the .exe file must to an .msi file by using a third-party utility.

Manage software upgrades by using group Policy
* You can redeploy a package if the original Windows Installer file has been modified.
* Upgrades will often remove the old version of an application and install a newer version. These upgrades usually maintain application settings.
* You can remove software packages if they were delivered originally by using Group Policy. This is useful if you’re replacing a line-of-business (LOB) application with a different application. Removal can be mandatory or optional.
Assign and publish software

Assign software
Assigning software has the following characteristics:
* When you assign software to a user, the user’s Start menu advertises the software when the user logs on.
* Users don’t share deployed applications.
* When you assign an application to a computer, the application is installed the next time that the computer starts.

Publish software
Publishing software has the following characteristics:
* The Programs > Programs and Features shortcut in Control Panel advertises a published application to the user. Users can install the application by using the Install a program from the network shortcut, or extension activation can install the application. Extension activation will initiate the program installation when a user selects on a file type that is associated with the program.
* Control Panel does not advertise applications to users who do not have permission to install them.
* Applications cannot be published to computers.
