Explore Azure Active Directory


With more services available online and in the cloud, organizations are finding that they also need to define and manage cloud identities. 
As with on-premises identities, you can use cloud identities to authenticate and authorize users when they try to access resources.
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based service, where the primary purpose is to provide identity management, authentication, and access-control capabilities for other cloud-based applications.

Examine Azure Active Directory

You can use Azure AD to provide more secure access to cloud-based resources for organizations and individuals by:
* Configuring access to applications
* Configuring single sign-on (SSO) to cloud-based SaaS applications
* Managing users and groups
* Provisioning users
* Enabling federation between organizations
* Providing an identity management solution
* Identifying irregular sign in activity
* Configuring multi-factor authentication
* Extending existing on-premises Active Directory implementations to Azure AD
* Configuring Application Proxy for cloud and local applications
* Configuring Conditional Access for users and devices

Compare Azure AD and Active Directory Domain Services


Characteristics of AS DS

When comparing AD DS with Azure AD, it’s important to note the following characteristics of AD DS:
* AD DS is a true directory service, with a hierarchical X.500-based structure.
* AD DS uses Domain Name System (DNS) for locating resources such as domain controllers.
* You can query and manage AD DS by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) calls.
* AD DS primarily uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication.
* AD DS uses OUs and GPOs for management.
* AD DS includes computer objects, representing computers that join an Active Directory domain.
* AD DS uses trusts between domains for delegated management.

Characteristics of Azure AD
When comparing Azure AD with AD DS, it’s important to note the following characteristics of Azure AD:
* Azure AD is primarily an identity solution, and it’s designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) communications.
* Azure AD is a multi-tenant directory service.
* Azure AD users and groups are created in a flat structure, and there are no OUs or GPOs.
* You can't query Azure AD by using LDAP; instead, Azure AD uses the REST API over HTTP and HTTPS.
* Azure AD doesn't use Kerberos authentication; instead, it uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols such as SAML, WS-Federation, and OpenID Connect for authentication, and uses OAuth for authorization.
* Azure AD includes federation services, and many third-party services such as Facebook are federated with and trust Azure AD.

Compare Azure AD Premium P1 and P2 plans

Microsoft provides a free trial period that can be used to experience the full functionality of the Azure AD Premium P2 edition. The following features are available with the Azure AD Premium P1 edition:
* Self-service group management.
* Advanced security reports and alerts.
* Multi-factor authentication.
* Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) licensing.
* Enterprise SLA of 99.9%.
* Password reset with writeback. 
* Cloud App Discovery feature of Azure AD.
* Conditional Access based on device, group, or location.
* Azure AD Connect Health.


In addition to these features, the Azure AD Premium P2 license provides extra functionalities:
* Azure AD Identity Protection.
* Azure AD Privileged Identity Management.

Examine Azure AD Domain Services

Azure AD Domain Services provides several benefits for organizations, such as:
* Administrators do not need to manage, update, and monitor domain controllers.
* Administrators do not need to deploy and manage Active Directory replication.
* There’s no need to have Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins groups for domains that Azure AD Domain Services manage.

If you choose to implement Azure AD Domain Services, you need to be aware of the service's current limitations. These include:
* Only the base computer Active Directory object is supported.
* It’s not possible to extend the schema for the Azure AD Domain Services domain.
* The organizational unit (OU) structure is flat and nested OUs are not currently supported.
* There’s a built-in Group Policy Object (GPO), and it exists for computer and user accounts.
* It’s not possible to target OUs with built-in GPOs. Additionally, you cannot use Windows Management Instrumentation filters or security-group filtering.
