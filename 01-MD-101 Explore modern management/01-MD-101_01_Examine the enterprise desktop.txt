Examine the enterprise desktop


The enterprise desktop has evolved and can be a challenging task given the dynamic nature of the IT world today.
Just a few years ago, an enterprise desktop was typically considered an organization-owned computer or laptop that was either shared or assigned to a specific employee. 
Today, the enterprise desktop could be a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet. It may be owned by the organization, or it may be owned by an employee who works at an office, from home, or perhaps from a hotel room or a customer site.

Plan an application deployment


Application deployment planning consists of three phases: managing application inventory and compatibility, packaging applications, and providing life-cycle support.
* Application inventory and compatibility
* Application packaging
* Application life-cycle support (Deploying new applications, Installing new versions of existing applications, Updating applications)
* Application Delivery
* Microsoft Store for Business
* Microsoft Endpoint Manager
* Virtual Application Delivery
