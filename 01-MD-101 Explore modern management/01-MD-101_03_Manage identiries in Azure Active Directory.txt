Manage identities in Azure Active Directory


Similar to locally deployed AD DS, you manage Azure AD objects and settings, but by using a different set of tools.
When using Azure AD, you will need to create users, groups, and devices
Also, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure to configure and delegate permissions.
Unlike AD DS, you can manage multiple Azure AD tenants by using an account from a single tenant.

Examine RBAC and user roles in Azure AD

User roles in Azure AD
You can use three types of accounts with Azure AD:
* An organizational account that the tenant administrator or a co-administrator creates within the default Azure directory or any custom Azure directory—for example, user@domain1.onmicrosoft.com.
* An account that references an organizational account you create in other Azure AD instances—for example, user@domain2.onmicrosoft.com.
* An account that references a Microsoft account—for example, user@outlook.com.

Within Azure AD, you can configure users with the following roles:
* Global Administrator.
* Limited administrator.( Password administrator
* Service administrator
* Billing administrator
* Exchange administrator
* Skype for Business administrator
* User administrator
* SharePoint administrator
* Compliance administrator
* Security reader
* Security administrator
* Privileged role administrator
* Intune Service administrator
* Guest inviter
* Conditional Access Administrator)
* User.

Create and manage users in Azure AD

You can create two types of user accounts on the Azure portal:
* Member users. 
* Guest users.

There are essentially two ways to create and manage your users:
* As cloud identities by using only Azure AD.
* As directory-synchronized identities by using an on-premises directory service to synchronize with Azure AD.

Create and manage groups in Azure AD

You can create four group types in Azure AD:
* Security.
* Mail-enabled security. 
* Distribution. 
* Office365 groups.

Use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to manage Azure AD objects

To run the Microsoft Azure Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell module, you need the following requirements:
* Operating system.
* Microsoft .NET Framework.
* Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant.

Synchronize objects from AD DS to Azure AD

Azure AD Connect
* OU
* Domain
* User attributes
* Applications

When directory synchronization is enabled, you have the following authentication options:
* Separate cloud password.
* Synchronized password.
* Pass-through authentication.
* Federated identities.

When you choose express settings, the following options are selected:
* SQL Server Express is installed and configured.
* All identities in the forest are synchronized.
* All attributes are synchronized.
* Password synchronization is enabled.
* An initial synchronization is performed immediately after install.
* Automatic upgrade is enabled.

You can enable other options during installation when you select custom settings, such as:
* Pass-through authentication.
* Federation with AD FS.
* Select an attribute for matching existing cloud-based users.
* Filtering based on OUs or attributes.
* Exchange hybrid.
* Password, group, or device writeback.
* After deploying Azure AD Connect, the following occurs:
   * New user, group, and contact objects in on-premises Active Directory are added to Azure AD; however, no licenses for cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, are automatically assigned to these objects.
   * Attributes of existing user, group, or contact objects that are modified in on-premises Active Directory are modified in Azure AD; however, not all on-premises Active Directory attributes synchronize with Azure AD.
   * Existing user, group, and contact objects that are deleted from on-premises Active Directory are deleted from Azure AD.
