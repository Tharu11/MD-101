Manage Microsoft Defender in Windows client


A computer that is running Windows is more likely to face threats that originate from the network than from any other location. 
This is because attacks from the network can target a large number of computers and malicious users perform them remotely, whereas other forms of attacks require physical access to the computer.
Windows client has a built-in security platform called Windows Security.
