Implement device compliance policies


If your devices are managed by Intune, you can define how devices should be configured by using device compliance policies.
Compliance policies define conditions that device must fulfill in order to be compliant and able to access company resources.

Explore device compliance policy

Device compliance policies outline the required settings for:
* Passwords
* Encryption
* Jail-broken or rooted devices
* The minimum operating-system version
* The maximum operating-system version
* The maximum Mobile Threat Defense level

There are two types of noncompliant actions:
* Notify end users via email.
* Mark device noncompliant.

Device compliance policies can be used in the following manner:
* With conditional access.
* Without conditional access. 

Use Azure AD device groups for policies

A group membership rule is used to automatically populate a group with users or devices. This is a binary expression that results in a True or False outcome. The three parts of a simple group membership rule include:
* Property. 
* Operator.
* Value.

Deploy a device compliance policy

Before an organization can implement device compliance policies, it must first satisfy the following prerequisites:
* It must be licensed for Azure AD Premium P1 or Azure AD Premium P2 and Intune. Both are part of Microsoft 365 or Enterprise Mobility + Security, but they can also be obtained separately.
* Its devices run one of the following supported platforms:
   * Android
   * Android Enterprise
   * iOS/iPadOS
   * macOS
   * Windows 8.1 or later
* Its devices must be enrolled in Intune to be eligible for compliance management.

Explore conditional access

Conditional access is especially beneficial in certain scenarios.
* Supporting apps that require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Requiring MFA for untrusted networks. 
* Allowing Microsoft 365 access only to trusted devices.

Create conditional access policies

Conditional
A condition is a rule that Intune checks when performing conditional access. For example, a condition might be “when a device meets the password requirements.” Conditions can be based on the:
* Device platform that is accessing the data.
* Location from where the data is being accessed.
* Client applications that are used to access the data.

Controls
Controls are the actions that are allowed or disallowed when a condition is met. For example, with the previous condition, a control might be “allow access.” Controls include:
* Blocking access.
* Granting access if one or more requirements are met.
