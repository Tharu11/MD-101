Generate inventory and compliance reports


Microsoft Endpoint Manager provides several different options for creating and viewing reports.
Both Endpoint Configuration Manager and Intune provide out-of-the-box reports. 
You can also create custom reports by leveraging services such as the Intune Data Warehouse and tools such as Power BI.

Build custom Intune inventory reports

You can use the Intune Data Warehouse to build professional looking reports that provide insight into your enterprise mobile environment. For example, some of the reports include:
* Trend of users enrolling in Intune so you can optimize your license purchases
* App and OS versions break down so you can review that status of devices
* Enrollment and device compliance trends so you can smoothly roll out policy updates

The Data Warehouse provides you access to more information about your Intune environment than the Endpoint Manager portal. With the Intune Data Warehouse you can access:
* Historical Intune data
* Data refreshed on a daily cadence
* A data model using the OData standard

Requirements for accessing the Intune Data Warehouse (including the API) are
* User must be one of:
   * Azure AD global administrator
   * An Intune service administrator
   * User with role-based access to Intune data warehouse resources
   * User-less authentication using application-only authentication
* Install the latest version of Power BI Desktop. You can download Power BI Desktop from: PowerBI.microsoft.com

When accessing data in the Data Warehouse with Power BI, you have two options:
* Load the data in Power BI using the OData link
* Use the Intune Compliance App

Use the Power BI App
Alternatively, you can use the Power BI Intune Compliance app, which is in preview. This contains pre-configured reports focused on device compliance reporting. This uses the web version of Power BI and allows for customization and sharing of reports.
* Sign in to the Endpoint Manager portal and choose Reports.
* Select Get Power BI App, then Get it now.
* Install the App. You will either need to sign in with a user licensed for Power BI or sign up for a trial.
* Once in the app, note a message that sample data is being shown. Connect your data by signing in.
* When the data has refreshed (this can take up to 5 minutes), select the Intune Compliance workspace to view the dashboards and reports.

Access Intune using Microsoft Graph API

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can determine whether an application is installed on a user's device:

1. From Azure AD, get a list of devices registered to a user:
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/{user}/ownedDevices
2. Then view the list of applications for your tenant:
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps
3. Take the ID from the application and determine the installation state for the application (and therefore user):
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/{id}/deviceStatuses/
