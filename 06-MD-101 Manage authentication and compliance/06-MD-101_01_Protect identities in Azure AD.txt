Protect identities in Azure AD


As the number of different sets of credentials that one should manage increases, password security becomes weaker and weaker. 
Users often use the same password or very similar passwords for their private email accounts, social networks, and business accounts.
This results in a scenario, where a security breach of any user’s digital identity can jeopardize all other identities.
Because of this, it’s recommended that you use additional methods of authentication when authenticating against business resources, as well as to use alternative methods for authentication. 
In addition, you should use technologies that can monitor user identities and user account behavior and proactively work to protect and prevent attacks.

Explore Windows Hello for Business

On Windows 10 or later clients, Windows Hello for Business replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on PCs and mobile devices. This authentication consists of a new type of user credential that is tied to a device and uses biometric authentication or a PIN.

Windows Hello addresses the following problems with passwords:
* Strong passwords can be difficult to remember, and users often reuse passwords on multiple sites.
* Server breaches can expose symmetric network credentials (passwords).
* Passwords are subject to replay attacks.
* Users can inadvertently expose their passwords due to phishing attacks.

With Windows Hello, users can authenticate to:
* A Microsoft account
* An Active Directory account
* A Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account
* Identity Provider Services or Relying Party Services that support Fast ID Online (FIDO) v2.0 authentication (in progress)

Biometric sign in

On devices that support Windows Hello, an easy biometric gesture unlocks users’ credentials.
* Facial recognition.
* Fingerprint recognition.

Deploy Windows Hello

Deployment models
There are three deployment models from which you can choose:
* Cloud only.
* On-premises.
* Hybrid.

Explore Azure AD identity protection

Azure AD Identity Protection provides you with the ability to:
* Proactively recognize potential security risks and identify vulnerabilities in your organization.
* Automatically apply responses and actions when suspicious activity on one or more identities is detected.
* Properly investigate incidents and take actions to resolve them.

Manage self-service password reset in Azure AD
The self-service password reset functionality requires that you define alternative methods of authentication for users that have forgotten their passwords. Alternative authentication methods that are supported on Azure AD can be:
* Office phone
* Mobile phone
* Alternative email address
* Security questions

Implement Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication

You can implement multi-factor authentication in different ways based on users’ demands and the level of additional security that they need. The following are some ways to implement MFA:
* ou can use the Microsoft Authenticator mobile app as a software token to provide one-time passwords or to receive push notifications from the application.
* You can authenticate by using a phone call.
* You can authenticate by using text messages, which is similar to mobile app authentication, but the push notifications or the codes will come via text messages.
* You can use third-party OAuth tokens.

Multi-factor authentication comes as part of the following offerings:
* Azure Active Directory Premium licenses
* Multi-factor authentication for Microsoft 365
* Azure Active Directory Global Administrators
* Azure AD Premium or Enterprise Mobility + Security licenses
* setting up MFA
