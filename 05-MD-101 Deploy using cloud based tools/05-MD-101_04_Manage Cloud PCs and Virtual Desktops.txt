Manage Cloud PCs and Virtual Desktops


Virtual Desktops, as opposed to physical desktops, are becoming more popular for solving challenges related to providing remote access to resources.
Microsoft provides solutions such as Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365.
An Azure Administrator typically configures Azure Virtual Desktops (AVD).
Windows 365 Cloud PC, while built on the same fundamentals as AVD, can be set up and configured without Azure Administrator experience.
In either case, both platforms can be managed using the same methods as physical desktops.
