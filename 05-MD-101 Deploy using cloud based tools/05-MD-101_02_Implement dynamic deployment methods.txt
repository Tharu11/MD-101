Implement dynamic deployment methods


Even with the ability to reset the existing Windows image with Autopilot, sometimes even that isn’t necessary, especially with new devices purchased from an OEM.
A new device typically starts with a fresh install of Windows, and what’s typically needed is the correct edition deployed (such as Windows Enterprise or Education), correct configuration and apps.
When this is the case, dynamic provisioning can further simplify deployments.

Examine Subscription Activation

There are three main methods for activation:
* Retail
* OEM
* Microsoft Volume Licensing (volume activation)

Current volume activation methods

You can use any or all of the options that are associated with these models, depending on your organization’s needs and network infrastructure, including:
* Key Management Service (KMS).
* Multiple Activation Key (MAK).
* Active Directory-based activation. 

Subscription Activation
* Enabling Subscription Activation with an existing Enterprise Agreement (EA).
* Enabling Subscription Activation without an existing EA.

How Subscription Activation works
* An EA or a Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA). 
* An Enterprise E3 subscription via a CSP.

VDA Subscription Activation requirements

To enable Windows Subscription Activation, your VMs must:
* Run Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro
* Be a member of an AD DS domain or Azure AD-joined
* Be generation 1
* Be hosted by a Qualified Multitenant Hoster (QMTH), such as Microsoft Azure

Deploy using provisioning packages

You can use a provisioning package to modify a Windows installation and configure many runtime settings without having to reinstall the Windows operating system. For example, you can use a provisioning package to:
* Configure the Windows user interface.
* Add additional files or apps.
* Adjust connectivity settings.
* Meet mobile network requirements.
* Manage Certificates.
* Comply with security policies.
* Remove installed software.
* Reset the Windows installation to its initial state.

In a provisioning package, you can configure many settings such as:
* ComputerAccount
* Certificates
* EditionUpgrade
* Folders
* Policies

For example, by using the ComputerAccount setting, you can specify:
* The name for a Windows computer.
* Which domain the computer is a member of.
* Which organizational unit (OU) you want to create the computer account in.
* Which user account you will use to add the computer to the domain.

You can use the EditionUpgrade setting to:
* Upgrade Windows Pro to Windows Enterprise edition or Windows Education edition.
* Upgrade Windows Home to Windows Education edition without reinstallation.
* Change a product key.
* Perform activation by using the EditionUpgrade setting.
* Apply runtime settings to a running Windows computer, to an offline Windows image, or during the OS installation.

Use Windows Configuration Designer

Azure AD join with automatic MDM enrollment

Using Azure AD/MDM, you can:
* Join devices to Azure AD automatically
* Auto-enroll your users’ devices into MDM services
* Configure the joined devices by using MDM policies

The requirements for implementing the Azure AD/MDM deployment model are
* Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise edition
* An instance of Azure AD for identity management
* An appropriate MDM, such as Microsoft Intune
